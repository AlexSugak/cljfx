# Cljfx

Cljfx is a declarative, dynamic and extensible wrapper for JavaFX
applications.

## Rationale

I wanted to have an elegant, declarative and composable UI
library for JVM and couldn't find one. Cljfx is inspired by react,
reagent and fn-fx.

Like react, it allows to specify only desired layout, and handles
all actual changes underneath. Unlike react (and web in general) it does
not impose xml-like structure of everything possibly having multiple
children, thus it uses maps instead of hiccup for describing layout.

Like reagent, it allows to specify component descriptions using simple
constructs such as data and functions. Unlike reagent, it rejects using
multiple stateful reactive atoms for state and instead prefers composing
ui in more pure manner.

Like fn-fx, it wraps underlying JavaFX library so developer can describe
everything with just data. Unlike fn-fx, it is more dynamic, allowing
users to build prop maps for components in runtime, and has more
explicit and extensible lifecycle for components.

## Introduction

### Hello world

Components in cljfx are described by maps with `:fx/type` key. By
default, fx-type can be either a keyword corresponding to some JavaFX
class, or a function, which receives this map as argument and returns
another description. Minimal example:
```clj
(ns example
  (:require [cljfx.api :as fx]))

(fx/on-fx-thread
  (fx/create-component
    {:fx/type :stage
     :showing true
     :title "Cljfx example"
     :width 300
     :height 100
     :scene {:fx/type :scene
             :root {:fx/type :v-box
                    :alignment :center
                    :children [{:fx/type :label
                                :text "Hello world"}]}}}))
```
Evaluating this code will create and show this window:

### App

To be truly useful, there should be some state and changes over time,
for this matter there is an `app` abstraction, which is a function that
you may call whenever you want with new description, and
cljfx will advance all the mutable state underneath to match this
description. Example:
```clj
(def app
  (fx/create-app))

(defn root [{:keys [showing]}]
  {:fx/type :stage
   :showing showing
   :scene {:fx/type :scene
           :root {:fx/type :v-box
                  :padding 50
                  :children [{:fx/type :button
                              :text "close"
                              :on-action (fn [_]
                                           (app {:fx/type root
                                                 :showing false}))}]}}})

(app {:fx/type root
      :showing true})
```
Evaluating this code will show this:

Clicking `close` button will hide this window.

### Atoms

Example above works, but it's not very convenient: what we'd really like
is to have a single global state as a value in an atom, derive our
description of JavaFX state from this value, and change this atom's
contents instead. Here is how it's done:
```clj
;; Define application state

(def *state
  (atom {:title "App title"}))

;; Define render functions

(defn title-input [{:keys [title]}]
  {:fx/type :text-field
   :on-text-changed #(swap! *state assoc :title %)
   :text title})

(defn root [{:keys [title]}]
  {:fx/type :stage
   :showing true
   :title title
   :scene {:fx/type :scene
           :root {:fx/type :v-box
                  :children [{:fx/type :label
                              :text "Window title input"}
                             {:fx/type title-input
                              :title title}]}}})

;; Create app with middleware that maps incoming data - description -
;; to component description that can be used to render JavaFX state.
;; Here description is just passed as an argument to function component.

(def app
  (fx/create-app
    :middleware (fx/wrap-map-desc assoc :fx/type root)))

;; Convenient way to add watch to an atom + immediately render app

(fx/mount-app *state app)
```
Evaluating code above pops up this window:

![](doc/state-example.png)

Editing input then immediately updates displayed app title.

### Map events

Consider this example:

```clj
(defn todo-view [{:keys [text id done]}]
  {:fx/type :h-box
   :children [{:fx/type :check-box
               :selected done
               :on-selected-changed #(swap! *state assoc-in [:by-id id :done] %)
              {:fx/type :label
               :style {:-fx-text-fill (if done :grey :black)}
               :text text}]})
```

There are problems with using functions as event handlers:
1. Performing mutation from these handlers requires coupling with that
state, thus making `todo-view` dependent on mutable `*state`
2. Updating state from listeners complects logic with view, making
application messier over time
3. There are unnecessary reassignments to `on-selected-changed`:
functions have no equality semantics other than their identity, so on
every change to this view (for example, when changing it's text),
`on-selected-changed` will be replaced with another function with same
behavior.

To mitigate these problems, cljfx allows to define event handlers as
arbitrary maps, and provide a function to an app that performs actual
handling of these map-events (with additional `:fx/event` key containing
dispatched event):

```clj

;; Define view as just data

(defn todo-view [{:keys [text id done]}]
  {:fx/type :h-box
   :spacing 5
   :padding 5
   :children [{:fx/type :check-box
               :selected done
               :on-selected-changed {:event/type ::set-done :id id}}
              {:fx/type :label
               :style {:-fx-text-fill (if done :grey :black)}
               :text text}]})

;; Define single map-event-handler that does mutation

(defn map-event-handler [event]
  (case (:event/type event)
    ::set-done (swap! *state assoc-in [:by-id (:id event) :done] (:fx/event event))))

;; Provide map-event-handler to app as an option

(fx/mount-app
  *state
  (fx/create-app
    :middleware (fx/wrap-map-desc assoc :fx/type root)
    :opts {:fx.opt/map-event-handler map-event-handler}))

```

### Special keys

Some components accept specially treated keys. Main uses are:

1. Reordering of nodes (instead of re-creating them) in parents that may
   have many children. Descriptions that have `:fx/key` during
   advancing get reordered instead of recreated if their position in
   child list is changed. Consider this example:
   ```clj
   (let [component-1 (fx/create-component
                       {:fx/type :v-box
                        :children [{:fx/type :label
                                    :fx/key 1
                                    :text "- buy milk"}
                                   {:fx/type :label
                                    :fx/key 2
                                    :text "- buy socks"}]})
         [milk-1 socks-1] (vec (.getChildren (fx/instance component-1)))
         component-2 (fx/advance-component
                       component-1
                       {:fx/type :v-box
                        :children [{:fx/type :label
                                    :fx/key 2
                                    :text "- buy socks"}
                                   {:fx/type :label
                                    :fx/key 1
                                    :text "- buy milk"}]})
         [socks-2 milk-2] (vec (.getChildren (fx/instance component-2)))]
     (and (identical? milk-1 milk-2)
          (identical? socks-1 socks-2)))
   => true
   ```
   With `:fx/key`-s specified, advancing of this component reordered
   children of VBox, and didn't change text of any labels, because their
   descriptions stayed the same.
2. Setting pane constraints. If node is placed inside a pane, pane can
   layout it differently by looking into properties map of a node. These
   properties can be specified via keywords namespaced by pane's
   fx-type:
   ```clj
   (fx/on-fx-thread
     (fx/create-component
       {:fx/type :stage
        :showing true
        :scene {:fx/type :scene
                :root {:fx/type :stack-pane
                       :children [{:fx/type :rectangle
                                   :width 200
                                   :height 200
                                   :fill :lightgray}
                                  {:fx/type :label
                                   :stack-pane/alignment :bottom-left
                                   :stack-pane/margin 5
                                   :text "bottom-left"}
                                  {:fx/type :label
                                   :stack-pane/alignment :top-right
                                   :stack-pane/margin 5
                                   :text "top-right"}]}}}))
   ```
   Evaluating code above produces this window:

## License

TBD, need to consult my employer first

## TODO

- add proper context instead of naive one
- add tests for various lifecycles and re-calculations
- optional flatten in wrap-many
- better support for multiple windows
- expand on props and composite lifecycle. What's known about them:
  - ctor:
    - scene requires root, root can be replaced afterwards
    - xy-chart requires axis, they can't be replaced afterwards
  - some props do not create instances, they use provided instead
    (dialog pane in dialog)
  - is it possible to inject components/lifecycles into cells? they are
    a bit different (triggered via updateItem), and instances are
    created for us, but otherwise it's just a node and we have props for
    them
  - prop in composite lifecycle may be a map or a function taking
    instance and returning prop!
  - changing media should re-create media player
- big app with everything in it to check if/how it works (generative
  tests maybe?)
- controlled props (mostly in controls, also stage's `:showing`)
- default `:managed` properties in controls
- default focus traversable of controls!
- default style classes!
- default on-x-changed prop change listeners!
- advanced docs: lifecycles, opts, contexts, styles etc.

## Food for thought
- research lazy-loading of classes
- wrap-factory may use some memoizing and advancing
- prop lifecycle
- how to handle dialogs, animations and other possibly missed things?
- escape hatch to force-re-render everything?
- make jfx-media and jfx-web optional?
- update to same desc should be identical (component-vec)
