    purposes. You can provide your data for custom lifecycles, or extend some default
    cljfx behaviour via these keys:
    - `:fx.opt/type->lifecycle` — a function that gets called on every `:fx/type` value
      in descriptions to determine what lifecycle will be used for that description
    - `:fx.opt/map-event-handler` — a function that gets called when map is used in place
      of change-listener, event-handler or any other callback-like prop. It receives that
      map with `:fx/event` key containing appropriate event data
